                        <p>Casey is one of our members who has been coming here for years. “It’s really just a cute quaint place with a great atmosphere and good coffee” Casey’s order
                        is always the same, every day at 7:45 am Casey walks into Seaside and orders a Sea Salted Caramel BrewTM with a Wave Washed BagelTM with cream cheese.</p>

                    <div class="item"><h1>Meet Stacy!</h1>
                        <p>Stacy has been taking Casey’s order for years and has it memorized more than him. “In all reality he thinks he likes two pumps of caramel but really he only
                        likes 1 and a half. He is a little picky about it but most of the time I have his order pre-made anyways so it works out.” Stacy says her favorite part of the
                        job is being close with the regulars its her favorite.</p>
