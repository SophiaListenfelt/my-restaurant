                <h1>How Seaside Came to be</h1>
                    <p>Seaside Coffee was a labor of love created by Sophia and Skyler. Two siblings brought together by a shared passion for coffee and a dream of building something together,
                        they both transformed a cozy, seaside nook into a charming coffee shop. Sophia handled the design and branding, infusing the space with a laid-back, beachy vibe, while her
                        brother took charge of sourcing high-quality beans and perfecting brewing techniques. Together, they crafted a welcoming atmosphere where locals and visitors alike could enjoy
                        expertly brewed coffee and relax by the sea. Seaside Coffee quickly became a beloved spot for everyone in town.</p>
